# MvcMovie Project

## Description

This is a .NET Core MVC-based project named "MvcMovie". The project's goal is to create a web application for managing a database of movie records. It showcases the basic functionalities of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.

Users can add new movie records, displaying the movie title, director, release date, and genre. Existing movie records can be updated or deleted. All movie records can be viewed in a simple and user-friendly interface.

The project also illustrates the use of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern in .NET Core. It also offers the understanding of how to work with databases using Entity Framework Core, the most popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET. 

The source code is managed using Git, with a .gitignore file setup to ignore files and folders that are not needed to be tracked, such as built application files, user-specific files, NuGet Packages, and IDE-specific files.

The project was initiated using the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface) with the command `dotnet new mvc -o MvcMovie` and can be opened in Visual Studio Code with the command `code -r MvcMovie`.

This project is suitable for learners who wish to understand the fundamentals of developing web applications using .NET Core and the MVC design pattern. It's also a great starting point for developers looking to create a simple database-driven web application.
